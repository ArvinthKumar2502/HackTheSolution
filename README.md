# HackTheSolution
This is an Application(Web Application) that the Health and Santinary Departmant could use to keep the city clean.</br>

## Problem Statement </br>
We do have waste lying in cities which makes it hard for cleaning staff to know which area requires attention and urgent garbage and  waste pickup. </br>
Hence it is important for the Sanitation department to be notified about those areas periodically to take  immediate action . </br>

## Usecase

### The General Public (Mobile Application)
The general public could install the mobile application and whenever they come across a Grabage dump </br>they could take a photo of it and upload it in the app along with it's location

### The Health and Santinary Departmant (Web Application)
The Health and Santinary Departmant could use the web application that provides the *location* of the grabage dump along with the *Waste Quantity Index* which helps them take quick and appropriate action.
